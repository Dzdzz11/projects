          With all that's happened in 2020, seniors are now entitled to more
          benefit programs than ever. Savvy Americans have been taking advantage
          of these benefits to recession-proof their finances. Yet each year,
          millions of Americans forget to apply for them, mostly because they
          don't even know they exist!
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result of forgetting to claim, they forgoe thousands of dollars
          in extra savings each year. To help we have listed the
          <strong>
            Top 11 Benefits of 2020 below which are still active.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Note:</strong> Many of these programs are only available
          online and
          <strong>could expire as early as this October.</strong> Therefore you
          should claim them as soon as possible.

          Tax planning can be quite a tedious process, but there are benefits
          for seniors to make tax less taxing:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Free Advice:</strong> IRS-certified volunteers will help older
          taxpayers with tax return preparation and electronic filing between
          Jan. 1 and April 15 each year.
        </p>
        <p>
          <stron>No Withdrawal Penalties:</stron> Anyone aged 59 or over can
          withdraw money from an IRA, without incurring the common 10% tax.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Catch-Up Contributions:</strong>Workers aged 50 or older can
          defer income tax on an extra $6,500 or a total of $26,000 if
          contributed to a 401(k) plan, resulting in a tax savings of $6,240 for
          an older worker in the 24% tax bracket.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Additional IRA Contribution:</strong>Workers age 50 and older
          can contribute an additional $1,000 to an IRA, or a total of $7,000 in
          2020.

          The security that life insurance gives you and your family is
          critical. While a nominal insurance of $25,000 sounds like a nice
          amount, the reality is it barely covers funeral costs and a few
          mortgage payments. A large policy can help<strong
